# Starlight Navigator

Welcome to Starlight Navigator, a browser-based card matching game where players must match tarot card symbols to plot a course guiding a ship through several jumps towards their destination at *'Founders Star'*.

## Gameplay

In Starlight Navigator, the player is tasked with navigating a ship through the vastness of space towards the legendary *'Founders Star'*. To progress, the player must match tarot card symbols by flipping cards and revealing their hidden symbols. Matching symbols awards resources which are essential for plotting the ship's course.

## How to Play

1. **Matching Cards**: Click on cards to reveal their symbols. Match pairs of tarot card symbols to gain resources.

2. **Plotting Course**: Use the gained resources to plot a course from star to star, guiding your ship towards *'Founders Star'*. Each jump consumes resources, so plan your route wisely.

3. **Reaching Founders Star**: Your ultimate goal is to reach *'Founders Star'*. Strategize your route, manage your resources efficiently, and overcome obstacles to complete your journey.

## Future Development

I am working on improving Starlight Navigator and adding new features. Here are some upcoming updates:

- Journey to a further galaxy, requiring more careful navigation and resource management.
- Discover more major arcana, with more complex card interactions.
- Rogue-lite elements, where cards, resources and abilities can be carried over from run to run.
- Enhanced visuals and animations for a more immersive experience.
- Explore a more varied emergent narrative, with small in-galaxy events, and messages from the ships' crews.
